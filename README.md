# PIZur_imager
Simple command line application in Python to interface PI (Physik Instrumente) controllers and Zurich MFLI Lock-in. When combined, these two instruments allow for highly resolved one/two-dimensional scans.
 As operating simultaneously with the softwares of the two instruments can be puzzling and time-consuming, this shell CLI aims at overcoming these difficulties with an all-in-one solution.
